        h3 Can I come and present a website that I've created?
        p Direct presentations of a website or a company are forbidden. We do not allow advertising of any type during the barcamp. Try to present an interesting technical solution, idea or topic that can teach something to the participants and feel free to use examples from your company or website. The key requirement is to make an interesting and/or useful presentation for the audience. Remember, our particiapants will "vote with their feet" and boring presentations will eventually end up facing an empty room. That's not something you'd want, would you?
