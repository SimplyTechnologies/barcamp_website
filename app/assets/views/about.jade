                p “BarCamp Yerevan” was first held on April 17-19, 2009. Armenian IT and new media specialists fell in love with the new type of “unconference” and each successive BarCamp, in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 attracted more and more people. In 2009 we only had 400 participants. Last year, in 2013, the number of developers, hackers, geeks, bloggers, journalists and online activists exceeded 1200.

                    | BarCamp is usually a “œnon-conference” in the sphere of information technology or “œIT,” new media and Internet. A “œnon-conference” is the unofficial, informal part of the conference supporting open discussions and a free exchange of ideas and opinions

                    | The philosophy of BarCamp is the following: all presentations are given by participants themselves, with no formally invited guest speakers and without the formality of traditional conference. Most revealing, the schedule of events is “œproduced” by the participants of the conference and is formed only after the conference opens, as participants add the presentations they want to hold on a white board.

                p The first ever BarCamp in the former Soviet Union was organized in Kyiv in October 2007. It brought together about 300 people from Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, and other countries from the region and featured around 45 presentations.
                p After BarCamp Kiev, there was “œBarCamp Baltics” in Riga (February 2008) and “œBarcamp Caucasus” in Tbilisi (June 2008). The wave of BarCamps continues.
